  Advanced coursework in time series analysis, statistical inference, and stochastic processes.

## Research and Projects

### SpatialFeatures Project (Honours Thesis)
Developed the "SpatialFeatures" algorithm to capture cellular-level features for spatial genomics, enabling insights into gene distributions at both super-cellular and sub-cellular levels. Created an R package to facilitate broader applications in spatial genomics.

### Classification of Mouse Brain Cell Images
Led a project utilizing deep learning models, specifically Vision Transformer (ViT), to classify frozen mouse brain cells. This project integrated advanced image processing and interactive Shiny apps, achieving top marks in my capstone course.

### Investigating Epidemic Spread in Networks
Simulated disease spread in network models using the SIR framework, demonstrating the effects of network structure on infection dynamics and peak spread rates.

### Predictive Modeling for Breast Cancer Diagnosis
Applied machine learning techniques, including LDA and Random Forest, for breast cancer diagnosis, achieving high predictive accuracy through rigorous validation methods.

### Airbnb Price Prediction
Built a machine learning ensemble model to predict Airbnb prices, employing SHAP for interpretability and Bayesian optimization for fine-tuning. Offered insights into key price influencers for Airbnb hosts and real estate investors.

## Professional Experience

- **Data Analyst Intern**  
  *DiAct Technology Co., Ltd. (Ipsos)*, Shanghai, China  
  *Jan 2022 – May 2022*
