## Introduction

This analysis investigates the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to determine which features are most effective in distinguishing malignant from benign tumors. Specifically, we aim to answer the question: **What variables are most influential in predicting breast cancer diagnosis?**  
This analysis is intended for **medical researchers and clinicians** interested in exploring diagnostic features that can assist in early detection and classification of breast cancer tumors. The dataset was originally collected by Dr. William H. Wolberg and is available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://doi.org/10.24432/C5DW2B) [@wolberg_breast_1993].  
A complete data dictionary is provided below.

> **Note**: This analysis provides insights into diagnostic features in breast cancer, potentially guiding more advanced machine learning models.

## Descriptive Statistics

```{r}
#| label: descriptive-statistics
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
# Introduction: Load and inspect the first few rows of the dataset
data <- read.csv("example_analysis_data.csv")
data <- data %>% select(-id, -X) %>% rename(Diagnosis = diagnosis)
data$Diagnosis <- factor(data$Diagnosis, levels = c("B", "M"))
head(data)

# Summary: The dataset includes various tumor measurements, with a diagnosis column indicating benign or malignant tumors.
```

## Target Variable Distribution
This bar plot shows the distribution of benign and malignant diagnoses in the dataset.

```{r}
#| label: target-variable
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
#| warning: false
# Plot the distribution of tumor diagnoses
ggplot(data, aes(x = Diagnosis, fill = Diagnosis)) +
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), vjust=-0.3) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Tumor Diagnoses in the Dataset",
    subtitle = "Benign tumors are more frequent than malignant tumors",
    caption = "This plot shows the count of benign and malignant tumors in the dataset",
    x = "Tumor Diagnosis",
    y = "Count of Cases"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("B" = "#00CCCC", "M" = "salmon")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Summary:** Benign tumors are more common than malignant tumors, providing a slightly imbalanced but sufficient dataset for training.

## Faceted Plot: Feature Distribution by Diagnosis

This faceted histogram compares the distribution of `radius_mean` between benign and malignant tumors.

```{r}
#| label: faceted-plot
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 8
#| warning: false
# Compare the distribution of 'radius_mean' across diagnoses using faceting
ggplot(data, aes(x = radius_mean, fill = Diagnosis)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, alpha = 0.7, position = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~ Diagnosis) +
  labs(
  title = "Distribution of Mean Radius by Tumor Diagnosis",
  subtitle = "Malignant tumors tend to have a larger mean radius",
  caption = "Faceted histograms showing 'radius_mean' distribution for each diagnosis",
  x = "Mean Radius",
  y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("B" = "#00CCCC", "M" = "salmon")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Summary: The faceted histograms reveal that malignant tumors generally have higher mean radius values compared to benign tumors.

## Correlation Analysis

```{r}
#| label: correlation
#| fig-height: 10
#| fig-width: 10
#| warning: false
# Compute and visualize correlations among numeric features
correlations <- cor(data %>% select(-Diagnosis), method = "pearson")
corrplot(correlations, number.cex = .6, method = "number", type = "upper", tl.cex=1, tl.col = "black", col = COL2("RdYlBu"))
```

**Summary:** Strong correlations are seen among features like radius, perimeter, and area, indicating redundancy that can be reduced.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

```{r}
#| label: pca-analysis
#| fig-height: 8
#| fig-width: 10
#| warning: false
# Perform PCA for dimensionality reduction
pca <- prcomp(data %>% select(-Diagnosis), scale = TRUE)

# Variance explained by each component
var_explained <- data.frame(
  Component = 1:length(pca$sdev), 
  Variance = (pca$sdev)^2, 
  Proportion = (pca$sdev)^2 / sum((pca$sdev)^2), 
  Cumulative = cumsum((pca$sdev)^2 / sum((pca$sdev)^2))
)

# Scree Plot
ggplot(var_explained[1:10,], aes(x = Component, y = Proportion)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "salmon") +
  geom_line(color = "black") +
  geom_point(color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Explained Variance by Principal Components",
    subtitle = "The first few components capture the majority of variance",
    caption = "Scree plot showing the variance explained by the first 10 components",
    x = "Principal Component",
    y = "Percentage of Explained Variance"
  )
```

## Data Splitting

```{r}
#| label: data-split
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
# Split the data into training and testing sets
set.seed(101)
split <- sample.split(data$Diagnosis, SplitRatio = 0.8)
train <- subset(data, split == TRUE)
test <- subset(data, split == FALSE)
```

**Summary:** The training set has 455 samples, and the test set has 114 samples, with consistent diagnosis distribution.

## Model Training: Random Forest

```{r}
#| label: model-training
#| echo: true
# Set up cross-validation
control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

# Random Forest
rf_model <- train(Diagnosis ~ ., data = train, method = "rf", ntree = 1000, trControl = control, importance = TRUE)
```

**Summary:** A Random Forest model with cross-validation is trained to predict tumor diagnoses based on the dataset features.

## Model Evaluation

```{r}
#| label: model-evaluation
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
# Evaluate the Random Forest model on the test set
evaluate_model <- function(model, test_data) {
  predictions <- predict(model, newdata = test_data)
  cm <- confusionMatrix(predictions, test_data$Diagnosis)
  auc_value <- auc(roc(test_data$Diagnosis, as.numeric(predictions)))
  data.frame(
    Accuracy = cm$overall['Accuracy'],
    Sensitivity = cm$byClass['Sensitivity'],
    Specificity = cm$byClass['Specificity'],
    AUC = auc_value
  )
}

rf_results <- evaluate_model(rf_model, test)
rf_results
```

**Summary:** The model achieves high accuracy and AUC, indicating effective classification of benign and malignant cases.

## ROC Curve for Random Forest Model

[@romano2023modeling]

```{r}
#| label: roc-curve
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 10
#| warning: false
# Introduction: Plot the ROC curve to visualize model performance
rf_roc <- roc(test$Diagnosis, as.numeric(predict(rf_model, newdata = test)))
rf_df <- data.frame(Specificity = 1 - rf_roc$specificities, Sensitivity = rf_roc$sensitivities)

# Plot ROC curve using ggplot2
ggplot(rf_df, aes(x = Specificity, y = Sensitivity)) +
  geom_line(size = 1, color = "green") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray") +
  labs(
    title = "ROC Curve for Random Forest Classification",
    subtitle = "High AUC reflects strong model discrimination ability",
    caption = "ROC curve shows sensitivity vs. specificity for the Random Forest model",
    x = "1 - Specificity (False Positive Rate)",
    y = "Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1))
```

**Summary:** The ROC curve with AUC ~0.98 indicates the Random Forest model’s high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing malignant from benign tumors.

## Summary
This analysis indicates that tumor characteristics such as radius, perimeter, and area are highly indicative of a malignant diagnosis. The data shows significant variability in these features between benign and malignant diagnoses, with malignant tumors generally exhibiting larger values. The correlation matrix highlights redundancy among some features, suggesting that dimensionality reduction could be beneficial for predictive modeling. Overall, this preliminary analysis provides insights that can guide further diagnostic model development.

> **Conclusion**: This study identifies key features in breast cancer diagnosis, providing a foundation for future predictive analysis and model building in clinical applications.
